A simple program that generates a curve of 1's in a matrix of 0's

I want to keep the old methods in comments because i hope it would help someone.

I will come with new updates soon.
Please tell me if you find any bugs.

[fix_0] - Changed the way we return the matrix's value, see [fix_0] in the code for more details
